# Fraud Detection Project 💳✨

Welcome to my little corner of fraud detection!  
In this repository, you'll find my **Jupyter Notebook** where I explore and analyze credit card transactions to detect potential fraud.  

Here you'll see:
- Data exploration and visualization 📊  
- Analysis of transaction patterns 🔍  
- Insights and findings 💡  

This project is a fun way for me to practice **data analysis** and **machine learning** while working with real-world financial data.  

Feel free to explore and learn with me! 😊
